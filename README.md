# Controlling a USB to serial port relay board with Python

This repository contains some notes and example code for controlling
a LCUS USB to serial port relay board.

The code was developed and tested using an LCUS-4 board, possibly manufactured by 'EC Buying'.
It should also work with other similar boards including the LCUS-1, LCUS-2 and LCUS-8.

The example script is free to use and adapt as you wish.
Guidance on how to use it are provided as inline comments.
Hopefully it's self-explanatory. Good luck!
